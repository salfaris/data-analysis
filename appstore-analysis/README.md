An analysis of Apple App Store in Jupyter Notebook

Everyone uses mobile apps nowadays - from video games to task managers. As technology gets more advanced, mobile apps becomes easier to create. There are even services that allow individuals with zero coding experiencce to create web and mobile apps now. Consequently, the growth of the number of apps in the App Store have risen tremendously over the years.

The project is an exploratory data analysis of the App Store, Apple's app market using a modified dataset `AppleStoreData.csv` retrieved from Kaggle which contains details of approximately 7000 number of apps.

In this exploration, I have utilized the `pandas`, `matplotplib`, `plotly` and `seaborn` libraries in Python 3 to make a comprehensive analysis of the dataset. As seen in the notebook, I was able to answer questions like:

- Is there any linear correlation between say user ratings and app price?
- Is there any specific app genre dominating the market?
- Which genre has the highest number of shares in the app store?
- Are there any genres with fewer than 50 apps?
- How is the app ratings distributed?
- Is there a relation between app price and user ratings?
- Is there a relation between app size and user ratings?
- Is there a relation between app category and app price?

Some of the answers to these questions might be surprising at first (for example, spoiler alert: the answer to the first question is negative). However, this is what the data tells us, it is the voice of the consumers, the voice of the users.
